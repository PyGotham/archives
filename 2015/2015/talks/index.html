          <p>Python offers excellent frameworks for unit and integration testing. However, many people don't realize that Python also has tools that have been built for Acceptance Test Driven Development. This talk will focus on Behave, an acceptance test development tool similar to Cucumber. Behave uses Python and Selenium, making available the libraries of both to create robust testing for front end applications.</p>

          <p>This is a talk about inverse problems and improving on past algorithms that have focused on inverse problems in math, data science, tomography, and image processing. We use a new iterative method coded in Python's Numpy and show it's ability to recover images compared to previous approaches.</p>

          <p>Qt is a mature C++ framework for building cross-platform, native GUI applications that target Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile, and embedded platforms.  PyQt (and PySide) provides python bindings for the Qt library, and allows one to quickly and easily build GUI applications in pure Python.  While web-based and mobile development gets all the attention these days, there are still many use-cases for which native apps are much more suitable.  Qt provides an extremely rich and well-designed set of classes to build complex user interfaces both visually (with Qt Designer) and programmatically, and PyQt makes building native apps incredibly fast and easy.  This tutorial will introduce the main ideas and modules in Qt and how the bindings work, and demonstrate building an application from scratch with PyQt.</p>

          </h4>
          <p>In New York City, building management agents and steam heating contractors alike typically work with hundreds of buildings and at least as many boilers.  When there is an issue with the boiler, they need to be able to get as much data about that specific boiler as quickly as possible. Thankfully, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have published databases online with various data on publicly registered boilers and burners. In this talk, I will discuss the methods I have used to scrape these boiler and burner data from the web using python libraries.</p>

          <p>When it comes to open source software, what do you want to be doing?
Do you want an occasional hobby where you can have fun contributing
back to the community? Have a significant impact on the world by being
able to commit full time to growing the available pool of free &amp; open
source software? Spend time getting to know the needs of a particular
organisation, and applying open source tools to solve their problems?
Or perhaps you'd prefer to understand the general needs of a broad
category of potential users, and design open source tools that will
solve their problems without customisation?</p>
<p>Getting involved in open source development communities can offer all
these opportunities and more, but it also makes it incredibly easy for
us to overcommit and burn ourselves out. If we're not careful, our
unrealistic expectations can also contribute to the burnout of our
peers. To ensure sustainability, we need to come to a shared
understanding of some of the different ways we can engage with open
source communities, what we can reasonably offer for free, and what we
should expect to be paid for.</p>

What may begin as simply running  <cite>python my_app.py</cite> eventually bloats as you add more apps, more databases, more testing frameworks, and more developers. We'll talk about the evolution of a typical development environment, how it lets us down, and how we try to make it better. We'll end with an introduction to Dusty, a new tool which uses Docker containers to take our development environments to the next level.</p>

          <p>Dask is an open source, pure python library that enables parallel larger-than-memory computation in a novel way. We represent programs as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) of function calls. These graphs are executed by dask's schedulers with different optimizations (synchronous, threaded, parallel, distributed-memory). Dask has modules geared towards data analysis, which provide a friendly interface to building graps. One module, dask.array, mimics a subset of NumPy operations. With dask.array we can work with NumPy like arrays that are larger than RAM and parallelization comes for free by leveraging the underlying DAG.</p>

          <p>Numerical estimates of the derivative of a function are typically done using an approximation called "Finite Difference." However, the accuracy of this method is computationally bounded. Using Complex Analysis, we're able to take the step in the imaginary direction on the complex plane and achieve near perfect estimation of the derivative in only three lines of code!</p>

          <p>Python 3's new “asyncio” module is an efficient async framework similar to Node. But unlike Node, it emphasizes a modern idiom called "coroutines", rather than callbacks. Coroutines promise the best of two worlds: the efficiency of callbacks, but with a natural and robust coding style similar to synchronous programming.</p>
<p>In barely 30 minutes I live-code a Python 3 async framework. First, I show how an async framework uses non-blocking sockets, callbacks, and an event loop. This version of the framework is very efficient, but callbacks make a mess of the code. Therefore, I implement coroutines using Python generators and two classes called Future and Task, and update my little framework to use coroutines instead of callbacks.</p>
<p>The live-coding demo isn't just a magic trick: watch to see how simply a coroutine-based async framework can be implemented, and gain a deep understanding of this miraculous new programming idiom in the Python 3 standard library.</p>

          <p>Many developers see code review as a way to keep code compliant and to reduce bugs, but code review can be so much more than that! In this talk, I’ll share how reviewing code became one of the most valuable ways for me to become a better programmer. I’ll cover how you can learn more from code review, how you can improve your skills as a reviewer, and how to influence your colleagues to give you better code review.</p>

          <p>Adaptive learning technology is used to provide personalized learning experiences for students. A common implementation provides individualized follow-up assignments for struggling students.   Using observed data, we show how to use bootstrapping and rejection sampling to create a valid comparative study of groups of students who do and don’t use adaptive technology, even when the samples are not uncorrelated.</p>

          <p>At OpBandit, we built a Python Twisted service that renders different versions of news content for rendering on top publishers across six countries.  At a high level, whenever a reader requests a page on a publisher's website, our service selects from various versions of headlines and photos to deliver the collection of versions that we think a user is most likely to click.  This requires decision making on the fly for each request with hard requirements for speed and reliability.  This talk will cover how we used Twisted to scale our service to provide hundreds of millions of optimized pages / month for readers, as well as what it's like to attempt to scale real-time data science recommendation algorithms within Python.</p>

          <p>In this talk, I discuss my work using Python to create a system for sarcasm detection in speech.  My goal in this task is to determine whether human intonation alone can be modeled to predict sarcastic speech.  I first extracted speech samples from the titular character of MTV’s late ‘90s hit TV show “Daria”.  Using crowdsourcing techniques to get the speech labeled for sarcasm, I created a corpus of speech that is annotated for sarcasm and sincerity.  I used several Python toolkits to extract a number of acoustic features from this speech that are indicative of sarcasm.  The first tool I used was Snack Sound Toolkit, a library for Python that does basic sound handling and analysis.  I used tools in Snack to extract a baseline of basic acoustic features that have been found to be helpful in human sarcasm identification.  I then used NumPy, SciPy, and NLTK to model prosodic contours, and applied these contours to the task of automatic sarcasm detection.  This approach applies sequential modeling to representations of pitch and intensity curves obtained via k-means clustering.  Using machine learning (specifically Weka’s SimpleLogistic (LogitBoost) classifier), this system is able to predict sarcasm with 81.57% accuracy.</p>
