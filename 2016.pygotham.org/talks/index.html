          </h4>
          <p>Programming can seem difficult because of the enormous level of abstraction involved. Objects are being dealt with that have very little to do with the real world. They are hard to grasp, touch, and feel. Chess on the other hand is a very concrete and physical game. Objects such as the board, pieces, and even logic such as the basic rules of the game are much easier to understand. How the pieces in chess interact, their capabilities, and their placement on the board can be similar to the way objects interact in python. Using chess_py, an open source platform for chess written by me in python, we can delve into the different classes and data structures to understand how they work and gain a deeper understanding of the language of python.</p>

          </h4>
          <p>PPCL (Powers Process Control Language) is a custom language for building systems controllers by Siemens.  It is similar to Basic (and essentially the same vintage), and is very difficult to use in the Siemens-provided text editor.  It is incredibly cumbersome to bulk edit (if at all possible), and doesn't have customizeable syntax highlighting, or the freedom to modify any of the editing parameters.</p>
<p>When writing a lot of Siemens PPCL, it is very time consuming and frustrating.  In having to write and edit large amounts of this code, I made a plugin for Sublime Text 3 and a syntax that allow me to edit code much more quickly.</p>

          <p>You know clone, commit, push, and pull. Now you're ready for the fun stuff. This talk will give you the advanced knowledge you need to take control of your Git repository: rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, blame, squashing, and the reflog. You'll also get a better conceptual understanding of how Git works, allowing you to chain these tools together to accomplish whatever task you need.</p>

          </h4>
          <p>In many Django applications, permissioning (building rules for who has access to what) is pretty easy. Logged out users can see some stuff, logged in users can see more stuff, and superusers can see (and edit, and delete) all of the stuff! But when you want to handle more complex permissioning (like object-level permissions), it can get pretty ugly. This talk will help to de-uglify things for you.</p>

          <p>At Peloton our data is pedaling speed and resistance from every second while a user rides their bike. We can use this data to generate music that plays back to the user. One way to generate unique and interesting sounds is using Pyo, a python-based DSP library, in combination with custom MIDI samples. This talk will cover how we structure this data, turn the data into music, and stream it to the user using a python-based pipeline.</p>

          <p>Sampling is often necessary when you want to understand some aspects of your data but you don’t have the memory or time to analyze the full data set. This is a simple task when your data is on disk - but is much more complicated when your data is an incoming stream of unknown (but very long) length. In this talk I’ll present several methods to do this, some of which get you samples that are unbiased over the entire stream and some of which produce samples that are biased towards the present, and the tradeoffs these algorithms entail.</p>

          <p>Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning focused on discovering ‘optimal policies’: robust strategies to achieve a desired objective under varying states of the world. In this talk, we will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and sample Python programs for basic algorithms to learn policies.  We will also discuss the state of the art in reinforcement learning and the ways in which reinforcement learning can be applied to real world problems.</p>

          <p>Finding outliers in a dataset is a challenging problem in which traditional analytical methods often perform poorly. As a result, researchers have developed special algorithms for detecting anomalies. In this talk, I will take about three different families of anomaly detection algorithms: Density-based methods, data streaming methods, and time series methods. I will cover both the mathematical and statistical theory behind these algorithms and provide code implementations. Afterwards, I will discuss useful tips I have learned  while implementing threat detection systems in practice.</p>

This talk discusses various ways of accomplishing this with multiple tested pathways. Who should come to this talk? Data Scientists, Web-Devs, Dev-Ops, if you've written code you want others to use, if you want to write code that others will use, this is for you. Who shouldn't come to this talk? If you already publish your own packages on PyPI and you get no joy out of critiquing people who give Best Practices talks, you might benefit more from one of the other talks.</p>

The BitTorrent application will be built and presented as a set of steps (code snippets, i.e. coroutines) that implement various parts of the protocol and build up a final program that can download a file.</p>
<p>Attendees need not know Asyncio and will learn the relevant functions needed to accomplish the task. No prior knowledge of the BitTorrent protocol is necessary either.</p>

When the computers are far apart, we need to achieve distributed consensus, which is especially pernicious. How do we do it, why is this important for many Python applications, and how can an algorithm called Raft help us out?</p>

The talk will start with a high level discussion of asynchronous I/O and describe some example cases where it might be useful.  Concrete examples in both Twisted and Asyncio will be provided to demonstrate two different approaches to asynchronous libraries.  Then, in the primary focus of the talk, the process, challenges, and lessons from converting a complex library from Twisted to Asyncio will be covered.   This will include covering cases when a conversion should and shouldn't be undertaken, along with advice for anyone who wants to convert an existing library.</p>

Dplython is an open source Python library (inspired by R's "dplyr") that improves productivity by constraining analysis to a core set of the most common data manipulation operations. By mapping the way we think about typical tasks to functions, dplython moves data analysis closer to "speed-of-thought." In this talk, I'll describe the core ideas behind dplython, present a tutorial on using it for data analysis, and give a technical peek at Pythonic lazy evaluations created with operator overloading.</p>

With the right tools, you can optimize your code where it counts. With the Python profiler “Yappi” to understand its features and limitations we’ll learn how to find the maximum performance wins with minimum effort.</p>

          <p>When you first start your Django project, adding  functionality to
your model comes really easy, because IT IS really easy to do so.
However, as your application size
grow, the code you end up might not be easy to work on anymore. As
engineers, we should pay attention to scalability not only in terms of
number of requests your server can handle, but also how your
application can grow with more features, and more engineers working on
it.</p>
<p>Code scalability is the ability to grow, modify, adopt your code
without a major refactor, lets say every 6 months with many people
working on it at the same time. While I know that it is really hard to
predict the future needs, and designing for future proof architecture
blindly is a waste of time and effort, I do see the need for some
forethought when you put together a solution. A good balance
between current need and future need can be achieved without
sacrificing a lot of productive time. Common smells that indicate
you do not have scalable code design are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineer cannot gain insight into what the code is doing by quickly reading the code  ( bug introduction because of mis-understanding )</li>
<li>Engineer cannot confidently make change to small area of the code (productivity delay, bug introduction )</li>
<li>Engineer cannot easily evolve the data structure to support new use cases</li>
<li>Engineer cannot easily to test, modify isolated business logic</li>
</ul>
<p>All the the above are usually seen when you have a big Django model file with each model having multiple functionality. I would like to review some basic principles to help us build a scalable software system.</p>

Quite unlike traditional databases, WADE is a framework. Programmers implement the storage interface themselves and write custom query or update functions in Python that are executed by the database avoiding the dreaded read-write update cycle that degrades performance. Since the storage layer is implemented by the programmer it can be hand customized to the use case at hand using tools such as LevelDB, RocksDB, or whatever the programmer desires. However, WADE takes control at the networking layer handling replication, message forwarding amongst nodes, and fault tolerance in the event of failure so long as a few simple functions are implemented by the end user.</p>

What are the main differences in the development and how to get started with GraphQL on Python/Django are questions that are going to be answered during this talk.</p>

          <p>I love python, and I am interested in Go. Recently, Go has gain the ability to create shared object files, which allows you to dynamically link Go code with other languages. This talk goes over the how, why, pros and cons of wrapping Go's shared object files in python.</p>

          <p>This talk will describe an ongoing effort to treat agent interactions as abstract algebraic structures. The primary motivations for this attempt it are to increase code reuse, and ultimately to enable the creation of agent-based models through the filling in of forms, choosing among various module operations and chaining them together to produce customized agent behavior.</p>

          <p>Since PyCon 2013, interest in the Young Coders class has intensified. Several Python conferences have run their own, and classes outside of conferences - from one-time workshops to after school clubs - have sprung up as well. With more people than ever interested in teaching Python to kids, I'm here to talk about what you'll need to get started, and the immense amount of satisfaction you'll get out of it.</p>
