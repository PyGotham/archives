    <h1>Recording Release</h1>

    <p>Part of the motivation for PyGotham 2016 is to help with Python
      education and advocacy in New York City. Accordingly, we intend to record
      all PyGotham 2016 presentations and release the recordings on the
      web (see <a href="http://pyvideo.org">http://pyvideo.org</a>).</p>

    <p>By submitting your talk or tutorial proposal, or by signing up to give a
      lightning talk, you agree to give permission to Big Apple Py to record,
      edit, and release audio and/or video of your presentation.</p>

    <p>By default, the recording release checkbox is checked when submitting a
      proposal. If you wish to opt-out, uncheck the release checkbox, note that
      while a recording of your talk will be made, it will be destroyed during
      post production. You cannot opt out of recording for lightning talks.</p>

    <p>You agree to the following legalese, which certifies that you are the
      author of your presentation (or otherwise allowed to present it at PyGotham 2016), and which allows Big Apple Py 1) to perform the
      necessary audio and video editing needed to prepare your presentation, and
      2) to distribute the recordings to other people, including on YouTube, or
      video sites. It also allows other people to watch the recordings.</p>

    <p>Legalese:</p>

    <pre>
      I certify that I, the Submitter, am authorized to license this proposal
      and its associated presentation (the "User Submission") to Big Apple Py
      ("BAP") for use in association with PyGotham 2016. Specifically:

      - I, the Submitter, certify that I am either the copyright owner of the
      User Submission or an authorized licensee of the copyright owner. If I am
      an authorized licensee of the copyright owner, I certify that I have
      sublicensable distribution rights.

      - I, the Submitter, hereby grant BAP a worldwide, royalty-free, fully
      paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
      copyright), sublicensable and transferable license to exercise the rights
      in the User Submission as follows:

      1) BAP is granted a license to reproduce the User Submission, to
      incorporate the User Submission into one or more Collective Works, and to
      reproduce the User Submission as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      2) BAP is granted a license to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

      3) BAP is granted a license to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
      display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
      digital audio transmission the User Submission including as incorporated
      in Collective Works; and

      4) BAP is granted a license to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
      display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
      digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

      - I, the Submitter, waive the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society, royalties for the public
      digital performance of the User Submission, subject to the compulsory
      license created by 17 U.S.C. Section 114 (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

      - I, the Submitter, specifically affirm the right to perform the User
      Submissions on BAP's web sites or on other web sites designated by BAP
      (including, but not necessarily limited to YouTube).

      - I, the Submitter, also hereby grant each person receiving the User
      Submission distributed by BAP a non-exclusive license to access, use,
      display, and perform the User Submission in a non-commercial, private
      context.
